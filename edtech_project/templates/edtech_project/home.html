    <p class="info">This website helps you learn how to read code. <br> <p>

    <h2 class="info-sections"> Why? </h2>

    <p class="info">There are many scholarly resources which indicate that students must be able to read code
                    before they can successfully write code (Lister et al., 2009), but that many students' ability
                    to read code lags behind their ability to write it (Denny et al., 2008). It often is not directly
                    taught in CS classes, but is a crucial skill nonetheless. </p>

    <h2 class="info-sections"> How does this website help? </h2>

    <p class="info">This website generates problems that require code comprehension to solve. The Practice section
        (which you can navigate to via the navigation bar at the top), will allow you to generate problems. The Generation Options
        panel contains settings that can be used to tune problem length, difficulty, subject, and syntax.
        A couple of notes to make: the "Difficulty" slider setting is directed related to the complexity of the syntactic structure of
        the code, so if all structures are disabled, this slider will not affect difficulty.
        Additionally, setting the "Problem length" slider to high values may increase the time it
        takes for problems to generate. Problems that match all provided structural and
        syntactical specifications may occasionally fail to generate. Increasing the Difficulty slider
        may increase this chance. <br> <br>

        There are several types of problems that may generate. Each is intended to be solved
        with mental math, but problems may occasionally generate that require pen and paper, and in rare
        cases, a calculator. Please contact the administrator if you find code that doesn't make sense, has syntax
        errors, or cannot be solved without an IDE (too challenging or complex). This site is still in
        progress, but the majority of problems should meet the intended specifications. <br> <br>
        
        Lastly, if you are logged in, you can use the History section to view previously
        attempted problems. You can create an account by using the link in the navigation bar at the top. 
        Problems only show up on the History page after they are attempted, and only the result of the first
        attempt is stored.
